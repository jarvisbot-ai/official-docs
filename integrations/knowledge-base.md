# Knowledge Base

## What is Knowlwdge Base

The primary purpose of a knowledge base is to enable computers to simulate understanding and to provide users with relevant, useful information based on their queries or actions.

A knowledge base can contain facts, rules, policies, procedures, and relationships between concepts, typically organized in a way that a computer program can interpret and use.
